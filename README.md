### Filters
On the subscriptions page, in the upper right next to manage, will be two drop down menus labeled 'type' and 'show'. Then select which filter you want to see for the page's videos to update. Note: a type and watch status filter can be applied at the same. Click on the star button to toggle the favorite set of filters. Set to unwatched videos by default, you can go into the options menu to pick your own from the drop down selectors. Clicking the button again while viewing your favorite will bring you back to the filters you had appied before switching.   

### Channel Filters
You can add and remove entries to the white/black list in the extension's options from the extensions page. Type the channel name and the keywords into the input boxes to add a new entry. Hover over any of the listed entries and click the X next to it to remove it. You can also import and export your filters using the buttons at the top on the options page. The import must be a json and will add all entries from the import into your current list while ignoring any duplicates.
